    <h2>Latest Project: Identifying COVID-19</h2>
    <h4>April 19, 2020</h4>
    <p>During this unpredictable time, it can be hard to differentiate common cold from influenza, and influenza from
        the novel coronavirus, along with many more respiratory related diseases. For this reason, I have created a
        utility to help you find out if the disease is the common cold, influenza, or the novel coronavirus. Please note
        that this utility is by no means accurate and should be taken with a grain of salt. It should not replace
        professional advice from your physician. If you have any doubts, please get medical attention.</p>
